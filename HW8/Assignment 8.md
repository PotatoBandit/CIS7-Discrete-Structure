  I have found TheTrevTutor videos to be super helpful. The video that has helped me the most was the video on Induction.
Of all the topics we have covered, I found induction to be really confusing. So I watched the class videos as well
as other youtube videos to better understand the concept. It really helps the way he breaks down the equations and shows
exactly what is being replaced to get to the next step. In class, we broke down the example from the slide. However, I felt
that example was hard to understand because it was written out horizontally. Seeing the problem broken down vertically, step by step,
really helped to clarify the steps and goal of induction.
